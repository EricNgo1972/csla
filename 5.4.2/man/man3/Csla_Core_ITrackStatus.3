.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsChild\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this is a child object, false if it is a root object\&. An object should be marked as a child object unless it is the top most object (root object) in a business object graph\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if this a child object\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsDeleted\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this object is marked for deletion\&. CSLA \&.NET supports both immediate and deferred deletion of objects\&. This property is part of the support for deferred deletion, where an object can be marked for deletion, but isn't actually deleted until the object is saved to the database\&. This property indicates whether or not the current object has been marked for deletion\&. If it is true , the object will be deleted when it is saved to the database, otherwise it will be inserted or updated by the save operation\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if this object is marked for deletion\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsDirty\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this object's data, or any of its fields or child objects data, has been changed\&. When an object's data is changed, CSLA \&.NET makes note of that change and considers the object to be 'dirty' or changed\&. This value is used to optimize data updates, since an unchanged object does not need to be updated into the database\&. All new objects are considered dirty\&. All objects marked for deletion are considered dirty\&. 
.PP
Once an object's data has been saved to the database (inserted or updated) the dirty flag is cleared and the object is considered unchanged\&. Objects newly loaded from the database are also considered unchanged\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if this object's data has been changed\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsNew\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this is a new object, false if it is a pre-existing object\&. An object is considered to be new if its primary identifying (key) value doesn't correspond to data in the database\&. In other words, if the data values in this particular object have not yet been saved to the database the object is considered to be new\&. Likewise, if the object's data has been deleted from the database then the object is considered to be new\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if this object is new\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsSavable\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this object is both dirty and valid\&. An object is considered dirty (changed) if P:Csla\&.BusinessBase\&.IsDirty returns true\&. It is considered valid if IsValid returns true\&. The IsSavable property is a combination of these two properties\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if this object is both dirty and valid\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsSelfDirty\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if this object's data has been changed\&. When an object's data is changed, CSLA \&.NET makes note of that change and considers the object to be 'dirty' or changed\&. This value is used to optimize data updates, since an unchanged object does not need to be updated into the database\&. All new objects are considered dirty\&. All objects marked for deletion are considered dirty\&. 
.PP
Once an object's data has been saved to the database (inserted or updated) the dirty flag is cleared and the object is considered unchanged\&. Objects newly loaded from the database are also considered unchanged\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsSelfValid\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if the object is currently valid, false if the object has broken rules or is otherwise invalid\&. By default this property relies on the underling ValidationRules object to track whether any business rules are currently broken for this object\&. 
.PP
You can override this property to provide more sophisticated implementations of the behavior\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if the object is currently valid\&.

.SS "bool Csla\&.Core\&.ITrackStatus\&.IsValid\fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Returns true if the object and its child objects are currently valid, false if the object or any of its child objects have broken rules or are otherwise invalid\&. By default this property relies on the underling ValidationRules object to track whether any business rules are currently broken for this object\&. 
.PP
You can override this property to provide more sophisticated implementations of the behavior\&. For instance, you should always override this method if your object has child objects, since the validity of this object is affected by the validity of all child objects\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A value indicating if the object is currently valid\&.
